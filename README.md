Task -Build a chatbot using Dialogflow and nodejs

Customers want quick, seamless solutions to their problems. Some are    used to the traditional way of phone support, therefore having a hard time accepting a chatbot with the notion that it is a robotic interaction, lacking the human touch. However, more and more customers are open to new technology, especially if it means a quick resolution to their issues. This is where a chatbot comes into picture. A chatbot is a software that communicates with users via a conversational interface be it textual or voice based. While most people associate bots with AI, they do not necessarily need to use AI to be helpful and  functional.

Use Node.js framework and Dailogflow to build a Chatbot and to store documents containing:

A defined classification or name of user input. This is the intent of the input/response interaction
A list of possible responses to send back to the user
A context value of the intent used to guide or filter which response lists makes sense to return
A set of patterns of potential user input. The patterns are used to build the model that will predict the probabilities of intent classifications used to determine responses.
